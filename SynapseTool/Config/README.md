# Config
Game config data is necessary for game designer. With config, designers do not require to know or modify game code. What's more, we can change the behavior or data of the game by changing the config without recompiling the project.

Here, we provide tools for editing game config data and export them for game runtime use.

## Editor
We provide a web-based local editor for game designer to generate game config data.

This editor provides the following features:
- (TODO) load config from local to editor
- (TODO) save config from editor to local
- define attribute name and data type
- (TODO) define attribute compulsary or optional
- (TODO) input field check corresponds to data type
- (TODO) cell level version distinguish
- append or insert new row
- copy and paste row data

## Exportor
We provice a tool to transfer raw editor config to json.
