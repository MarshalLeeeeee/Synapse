# Synapse
A server-client game framework based on C#.

## Environment
Visual Studio C# Console Projects are provided respectively for both server and client. NET 8.0 is used by our projects. NET 6.0 or lower is incompatible and will fail in build.

## Structure
The game framework is organized in [SynapseCommon](./SynapseCommon/), [SynapseServer](./SynapseServer/), [SynapseServer](./SynapseClient/). This enhances the reusability of implementation and decreases the cost of project management.
